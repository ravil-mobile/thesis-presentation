    Numerical \textbf{integration} of a system of ODEs by means of \textbf{W-methods}:
    
    \begin{equation}
	(I - h_{i}J)\delta y_{ij} = h_{i} f(t_{0} + j \cdot h_{i}, y_{0} + \sum^{j-1}_{l = 0} \delta y_{il}) + h^{2} \frac{\partial f_{0}}{\partial t}
    \end{equation}
    
    can be considered as a solution of a \textbf{sequence of linear systems} from another point of view:
    
    \begin{equation}
	A_{i} \delta y_{ij} =  b_{ij} 
    \end{equation}

    where $A = (I - h_{i}J)$ is a $\mathbb{R}^{N} \times \mathbb{R}^{N}$ non-singular \textbf{sparse matrix}; $\delta y_{ij}$  and $b_{ij}$ are $\mathbb{R}^{N}$ vectors; $i = 1, 2, 3$; $j=0, \dots, i - 1$\\
    
    \begin{block}{NOTE}
        Computational \textbf{burden} of the W-method mainly lies in \textbf{solving of sparse linear systems} beside evaluation of non-linear function $f$ of \eq{eq:athlet-8}

    \textbf{Efficient} numerical integration governed by W-methods \textbf{demenads} the following \textbf{properties} of a linear sparse solver:
    
    \begin{itemize}
	    \item robustness (or numerical stability) with respect to ill-conditioner problems
    	\item parallel efficiency, with emphasis on strong scaling 
    \end{itemize}
