    \begin{itemize}
	    \item As the first step, various preconditioning algorithms were tested
	    \begin{itemize}
	    	\setlength\itemsep{1mm}
	    	
	    	\item A coarse grid search was used
	    	
	    	\item with maximum 3 values for each tuning parameter 
	    	
	    	\item starting from the default towards more accurate values 
	    	
	    	\item Testing showed there was no preconditioning algorithm 
	    	
	    	\item that could result in convergence for the entire set of matrices 
	    \end{itemize}

	\item Even if we can find an algorithm and suitable parameter settings
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemsep{1mm}
		
		\item which will result in convergence of the entire matrix set
		
		\item there is no guarantee that it will work in all steps during a simulation
		
		\item Iterative methods cannot fulfill \textit{robustness} criterion
	
	\end{itemize}

	\item Therefore, direct sparse methods is only one way to go
	
	\item In spite of limited tree-task parallelism
\end{itemize}
