        \item Numerical Toolkit is a \textbf{container} of various \textbf{dense and sparse} linear algebra \textbf{subroutines}
        
        \item the main focus is \textbf{parallel execution} on distributed-memory machine
        
        \item based on Portable, Extensible Toolkit for Scientific Computation \textbf{PETSc}
        
        \item NuT design follows the paradigm of \textbf{Adapter/Wrapper} pattern which provides \textbf{uniform common interface} for its services 
        
        \item to achieve \textbf{re-usability}, flexibility and extensibility properties of the code
    \end{itemize}

            \setlength\itemsep{0.25cm}
         
            \item ATHLET is responsible for \textbf{marching} of the numerical \textbf{integration solver}
            
            \item ATHLET computes a \textbf{Jacobian} matrix approximation and the \textbf{right-hand sides}
            
            \item NuT  \textbf{solves systems} of linear equation
        \end{itemize}

        \begin{itemize}
            \setlength\itemsep{0.25cm}
            \item Implemented by means of \textbf{MPI}
            
            \item Communication is \textbf{synchronous} 
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    
        \setlength\itemsep{0.5cm}
        \item \textbf{Client-server} architecture is used 
        
        \item to \textbf{provide software coupling} between NuT and other GRS tools

        \item  The design allows \textbf{sharing} of some NuT-MPI processes \textbf{among} different \textbf{process groups}
        
        \item usually happens due to the finite number of processors on hardware e.g. laptops, PC, etc.
        
        \item it is better to avoid sharing
